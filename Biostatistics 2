# Analyze the loaded data and justify the method you have chosen for statistical analysis.

#### The table contains information about the growth of plants when they are grown with:
  # 1. only with glucose
  # 2. fructose only
  # 3. glucose and fructose
  # 4. glucose and sucrose
  # 5. without supplements, it is a control group

#We want to check whether there are statistically significant differences in the growth of plants in the specified conditions
#Since we have one group of plants, where we monitor the effects of different sugars, we can use one way Anova
#We could use a t test to compare each group with the control and with each other, but Anova does it all in one step

#Before that, you should check the distribution, variance and outliers
#The table does not contain NA values
