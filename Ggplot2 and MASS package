######### 1. Download the MASS package. There are various datasets in this package that can be suitable for learning and practicing.
zivotinje <- Animals

# Using this dataset, use the qplot function to create a scatter plot.

qplot(data = zivotinje, x = body, y = brain, color = "blue", geom = "point")1

# Increase the size of the dots relative to the default (size of your choice).

qplot(data = zivotinje, x = body, y = brain, color = "blue", cex =  0.1, geom = "point")

# Think about what needs to be done to make the graph better.

qplot(data = log2(zivotinje), x = brain, y = body, color = "blue", cex =  0.1, geom = "point")

# Add "smoother".

qplot(data = log2(zivotinje), x = brain, y = body, color = "blue", cex =  0.1, geom = c("point", "smooth"))

# Create the same graph via the ggplot function

z <- ggplot(data = log2(zivotinje), aes(x = body, y = brain))  
z + geom_point(aes(colour = "red", cex = 0.1)) + geom_hline(yintercept = 3, colour = "red") + 
  theme_classic() + geom_smooth(aes(x = body, y = brain))
  
########### 2. See the dataset "biopsy" (also belongs to the MASS package). The dataset contains the following columns. #############

#ID: sample code number (not unique).
# V1: clump thickness.
# V2: uniformity of cell size.
# V3: uniformity of cell shape.
# V4: marginal adhesion.
# V5: single epithelial cell size.
# V6: bare nuclei (16 values ​​are missing).
# V7: Bland chromatin.
# V8: normal nucleoli.
# V9: mitoses.
#class: "benign" or "malignant".

# Using the ggplot function, create the following graphics.

# stripchart showing V3 for benign and malignant tumors, but contains V5 information as dot size.
# Optional bonus: Set colors to any shade of green (bening) and any shade of red (malignant)

b <- biopsy
str(b)

bio <- ggplot(data = b, aes(x = class, y = V3, size = V5)) + scale_color_manual(values = c("#82E0AA", "#EC7063"))

bio + geom_jitter(aes(colour = class),width = 0.4, height = 0.7) +
  theme_classic() + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 10)) 
  
# Make a violin plot for benign and malignant tumors (x axis), and on the y axis let it be V8. Let the "trim" parameter be set to FALSE.
# Add a blue dot showing the median and a size of 6.5.

bio1 <- ggplot(data = b, aes(x = class, y = V8)) 

bio1 + geom_violin(trim=FALSE) +
  stat_summary(fun=median, geom="point", size=6.5, color="blue")
  
#Display distributions using a density plot (as a line-only histogram) for V6 data. Use the qplot function, not ggplot.
# The distributions for benign and malignant tumors should be on the same graph.
# Let them have different colors, but you don't have to adjust them yourself, let them be automatic.

qplot(data = b, x = V6,  geom = "density", color = class)

# Next, share the graph using facets.

qplot(data = b, x = V6, geom = "density", color = class, facets = ~class) 

# Show the V5 distribution using histograms for benign and malignant tumors. Use the ggplot function.
# Choose a dark theme.

bio2 <- ggplot(data = b, aes(x = V5, fill = class))
bio2 + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1.5) + theme_dark()

# Make histograms that are filled (completely painted) in blue and yellow (any shade)

bio4 <- ggplot(b, aes(x=V5, fill=class)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1.5)+ theme_dark() +scale_fill_manual(values=c("#0DAB9F", "#FEF01F"))

bio4

# See what happens when you set the color to class in aes within the ggplot function, when after that, set the fill parameter within the geom_histogram function to "gray".

bio5 <- ggplot(b, aes(x=V5, color=class)) + geom_histogram(fill = "grey",binwidth = 1.5)+ theme_dark() 
bio5 #the edges are colored, but interior is grey

############ Using the ggpubr package, create the following graphics. ##############

# Dataset biopsy.
# Boxplot for malignant and benign tumors, and colors according to the "Simpsons" palette.
# Set titles for the x, y axis as well as for the graphic.

ggboxplot(b, x = "class", y = "V1",
          title = "Klase tumora i velicine epitelnih celija", ylab = "Velicina celija",
          color = "class", palette = "simpsons")
          
# Create a barplot with error bars
# covered by individual measurements, which shows the same V1 values.
# Paint the bars light blue and red.

ggbarplot(b, x = "class", y = "V1", ylab = "Velicina epitelnih celija", 
          add = c("mean_sd", "jitter"),
          color = "class", palette = c("#D6EAF8", "#F1948A"))
